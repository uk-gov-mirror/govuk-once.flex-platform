// run time at all. That package declares no dependencies of its own, so naming an envelope costs
// a consumer neither the runtime nor the generator.

// It is a workspace package, so the import resolves for a consumer in this repository and nowhere

// or emitting the two shapes into this file instead; that choice belongs to the client library,
