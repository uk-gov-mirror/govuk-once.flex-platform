// Whether a schema admits a value, worked out by the library, dialect and formats the generated
// validators are worked out by. A second reading of what a schema means is a second answer, and
// the one that decides what an upstream takes is not this repository's: `{ "type": "integer",
// "allOf": [{ "minimum": 10 }] }`, a `$ref` with keywords beside it, `false`, a list of types,
// `const` and `enum` together, and the length of a string counted in code points are each a rule
// someone would otherwise have had to read the same way twice.
//
// Strict mode is off, where generating validators has it on, because the schema here is an
// upstream's own: it is read to find out what it makes of one value, and refusing it for saying
// something ambiguous would say nothing about that value. Turning it off is not free of
// consequence for the value, though — it takes `strictNumbers` with it, and a number that JSON
// cannot write would then pass where a generated validator refuses it — so that one is asked
// for by name.
//
// Nothing is written anywhere. Ajv says what it could not apply through a logger, which is a
// terminal by default, and what it would say carries an upstream's own words: a format named in
// the document reaches the line as it was written. Those are collected and answered with, so
// they leave through the one boundary that makes text safe to print.
